# Ornikar Swagger UI

This package makes it easy to make your project's Swagger (OpenAPI v3 JSON) file accessible in a Swagger UI right in your Laravel application.

The Swagger UI will automatically use your current project environment. It will set your api's base url to the active base url. Possible oauth2 configuration, such as urls and client-id/client-secret, can also be injected in Swagger UI via the configuration file.
